# CoupNash
Finds the nash eq for table top game Coup.

coup.py: implementation of game coup with simplifications in pyspiel format


in notebook
1. mccfr and bfs best response is implemented.
2. playground interface allow you to play against the trained agent.


Main results:

1. approximate game convergence with preferred player be 1 or 2.
2. nash gap convergence for small N ~ 10.
